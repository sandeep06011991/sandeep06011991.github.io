I am a final year PhD student in the College UMass, Amherst co-advised by Prof. Marco Serafini and Prof. Hui Guan.
I am currently on the Intern Job Market for Spring 2025 and full time for May 2025.
I work on systems optimizations for machine learning and have experience in areas such as GNN. 
I worked in compilers for machine learning space as well. 
Please contact me for more interesting opportunities.
